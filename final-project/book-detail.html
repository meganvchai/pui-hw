                                    A memoir from the New Yorker staff writer Hua Hsu, about his
                                    coming-of-age experiences with friendship, grief, the search for
                                    self, and the arts. Dedicated to his college friend Ken who died
                                    in a tragic murder, Hsu chronicles their unique friendship through
                                    shared their everyday college experiences and formation of an
                                    Asian American identity.

                                    I loved Hua Hsu's reflections on friendship and coming-of-age and
                                    how his writing felt so immersive and lyrical in this memoir. As a
                                    Berkeley alum, I especially enjoyed the nostalgia of his Berkeley
                                    college experience and how tangible it felt.

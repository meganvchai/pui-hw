## Feedback Summary

*Summarize all the critiques you received during the lab session (\~300 words).* 

### Book Recs Quiz
From the group critique, I got advice on incorporating JavaScript libraries and APIs for 3D animations. For accessibility purposes, I learned that I can include a static version of the page alongside the animated one. Prioritizing an MVP here is crucial, as for the timeline of this project having 3D animations on the website may be more engaging but more time-consuming to implement.For the book information database, a JSON file could serve as a sufficient database if I scope it down to just my own personal book recommendations, or sourcing an existing dataset.

### Personal City Guide
From the group critique, a classmate who took a class on accessibility mentioned that implementing tagging on the backend can significantly help with accessibility for users. Furthermore, I need to consider the scope of the city guide, such as if it is intended for a single city and if the audience is just shared to friends and family. Another approach suggested during the group conversation was about adding a feature that allows users to make plans within the app to make it more engaging. One critique was to avoid modeling the guide too closely after Google Maps, as a unique approach would be more beneficial for the final project.

### Spotify Aura Generator
From the group critique, it was suggested that to reduce complexity, I can narrow the project’s scope to a list of 10 songs for aura creation. Another way to reduce complexity is to limit the aura options to three types. Although Spotify’s API is public, one comment was that they were unsure of what specific information you can use to infer and map to aura types. Furthermore, because this is inspired by a previous Spotify Wrapped feature, it could be worth exploring how to take this idea in a different direction to make it a unique concept.

## Feedback Digestion

*Digest the feedback you got in the lab (\~300 words). Indicate which critique you will act on in your next design and why you chose to incorporate/dismiss pieces of critique.*

Based on the feedback I got in lab, the **Book Recs Quiz** emerged as a unique and manageable project. Recommendations to incorporate JavaScript libraries and APIs for 3D animations are valuable, but it’s essential to prioritize accessibility if I decide to use 3D animations. To address this, I will provide a static version of the page alongside any animations, ensuring that all users can engage with the content. Developing a MVP of my website, such as without the 3D animations, for the sake of the semester timeline would also streamline the development timeline and effort.

Using a JSON file as a database for personal book recommendations was suggested as a sufficient approach. This will help reduce complexity and align with my goal of creating a distinctive, personalized experience in a crowded market. Implementing backend tagging can further enhance accessibility, allowing users to navigate the quiz with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

For the **Personal City Guide**, feedback highlighted the importance of clarifying the project scope, such as whether it will focus on a single city and how it will be shared with friends and family. Adding a feature that enables users to plan activities within the app would increase engagement and also emphasize the individualized aspect of personal images and notes, while avoiding a design too similar to Google Maps will ensure a unique website experience. However, I decided not to move forward with this concept because its functionality could be implemented using Google Maps, although my idea is a more personalized, shareable version.

For the **Spotify Aura Generator**, the suggestion to narrow the project’s scope to a smaller list of songs and smaller number of aura types. Although the Spotify API offers public access, exploring how to creatively infer and map aura types will be essential to differentiate this project. I’ve decided to not pursue this idea because of its complexity of implementation, such as with inference and creating unique SVG gradients, and lack of originality compared to my other ideas.

For my final project, I’ll primarily focus on the **Book Recs Quiz** while also integrating feedback into the other two projects, so that I prioritize feasibility, accessibility, engagement, and uniqueness.
